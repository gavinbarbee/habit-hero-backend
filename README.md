# Habit Hero — Backend

This is the backend project I'm building to learn real software engineering,
clean architecture, and backend fundamentals using Python.

Right now it's a simple foundation with:

## What’s built so far
- Clean architecture structure (domain, application, infrastructure, presentation)
- User, Character, Habit, Streak, and HabitLog models
- In-memory repositories (safe storage for now, no database yet)
- A real use case: completing a habit
  - Updates streak
  - Gives XP
  - Saves a habit log
- Small CLI demo (`python main.py`)

## Why I’m building this
To learn backend engineering properly:
- real project structure
- clean code organization
- use cases
- domain logic
- eventually deploying a real service

This project will grow over time as I learn more and expand it.
